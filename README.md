This is a project from Roadmap.sh, here is the link: https://roadmap.sh/projects/expense-tracker
<p></p>
This project allows the user to keep track of expenses through the command line. You can add, delete, list, and summarize your expenses. You can also set a budget for a particular month. The budget is automatically checked when a new expense is added, but you can also manually  check with the check-budget command whenever you want. I have also implemented an export command to export the expenses to a CSV file.
<p></p>
The project currently keeps track of the budget and expenses with the use of .json files. The files in the project are populated with test data. They can be deleted and will be initialized again through running the project. The "expenses.json" file will be created once the first addition is made, and the "budget.json" file will be created once the first budget is set. The "expenses.csv" file will also be automatically generated by  the export command if it is deleted.
